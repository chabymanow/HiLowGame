Game rules:
> When cards are shuffled, the dealer will place one card face-down on the table and another one face-up. He will set aside the rest of the deck; players will then start predicting the value. After cards are dealt, the player is required to make his first bet. The house will then match the bet to the pot. The player is then required to predict whether the card is high or low   he will win or lose the pot depending on the results of his prediction. Depending on the card that shows, the player needs to make a guess on whether the face-down   card will be higher or lower than the face-up card. When the guessing is over, the dealer will flip the face-down card to show. When the guess is correct, the player will win and is able to choose to either double or collect winnings. When the guess is incorrect, the player will lose.
